      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p>This is how my Personal Page looks using CSS Styling</p>
      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p class="bio-parraf">I have been making games since 2015. My path started learning c# to use in Unity 3D.
        In the artistic side, I started learning how to make 3D models for those games. I started with 3D max and Maya.
        Then I earned an official Certificate of Higher Education in 3D animation, Videogames and Interactive Environments, from 2016 to 2018.
        At the same time on December 2017, I passed the Unity Developer Certificate, wich I did in english.(Proof that i can write speak it at some degree!).
        After that, I enrolled in a Master course in Organic Character Modelling in Zbrush, from April 2018 to February 2019.
        There have been many courses and lectures after that but the most notable ones are The .Net Core and Asp.Net and SQL course and the Asp.Net Core and React with Typescript course.
        So my skills are resumed in Videogame programming in c# and Unity3D and .Net apps and web development with React.
        But I can add more skills to it that like Html, Css, npm, Github... To name a few.</p>
